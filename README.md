# Visualizing Personal Spotify Data with Python and Tableau

### Step 1: Request Data from Spotify Account- 
Request a copy of your data from Spotify here. Be patient and wait a few days.

### Step 2: Prep Streaming/Library Data
Using the files Spotify has given us, we will now create one dataframe that includes all our streaming data PLUS whether each song is on our Library PLUS each song’s Spotify ‘URI’ (unique identifier — it’ll come in handy later)

### Step 3:  Loading Data into Tableau
Connect to your Excel file (MySpotifyDataTable.csv) as a data source.

### Step 4: Editing Fields in Tableau

We’ll add a calculated field to our data table. 
Convert Ms Played into Minutes Listened:
[Ms Played]/60000

### Step 5: Create Visualizations

We will create some sick visualizations for insights.
